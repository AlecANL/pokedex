## üé® UI/UX

After defining my tech stack, I started with UI/UX. This activity took me **4 man/day**. I spent 1 m/d finding my use cases using sites like Dribble, Behance, etc. After that I spent the remaining days in order to prototype my final UX using Adobe XD. Prototype is available [here](https://xd.adobe.com/view/011c7848-569e-43a0-4075-d53bbf04deee-772d/?fullscreen).

_For this project I skip wireframing step due to limited time_.

## üî® Development

After prortype a stable version, I started developement phase. This phase took me **4 man/day** and I work on client and server both.

**Server** implementation was already developed and I made small changes in order to support other filter criteria. Changes affects graphql schema and model implementation.

**Client** implementation was built from scratch. First of all I setted up project using UmiJS (create-umi-app). The result was a production-ready project that allow me to start (in 30 minutes) my development without worring about boring project configuration (webpack loaders, dev scripts, etc). When I develop I tried to follow TDD approch (although team was composed of 1 person (me ‚úåÔ∏è), so I tried to write a test for each implementations.
_Due to limited time I skip some improvements / implementations (you can see these in improvements section)_

## üì¶ Deploy

In order to view a live demo I made a deploy on a virtual machine powered by **AWS EC2** (Ubuntu). I had some paste experience, so, this task took me **0,5 man/day**.

## üìå Improvements

- Boost project collaboration introducing CI/CD workflow
- Use cached data, configuring cache with ApolloClient
- Improve stability introducing an error boundary
- Make application layout responsive
- Improve application loading satate
- Generate project doc (usign typedoc)
