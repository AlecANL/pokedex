## üé® UI/UX

After defining my tech stack, I started with UI/UX. I spent 1 men/day finding my use cases using sites like Dribble, Behance, etc. After that, I spent the remaining days in order to prototype my final UX using Adobe XD. Prototype is available [here](https://xd.adobe.com/view/011c7848-569e-43a0-4075-d53bbf04deee-772d/?fullscreen).

_For this project I skip wireframing step due to limited time_.

## üî® Development

After prortype a stable version, I started developement phase.

**Server** implementation was already developed and I made small changes in order to support other filter criteria. Changes affects graphql schema and model implementation.

**Client** implementation was built from scratch. First of all I setted up project using UmiJS (create-umi-app). The result was a production-ready project that allow me to start (in 30 minutes) my development without worring about boring project configuration (webpack loaders, dev scripts, etc). During development I include some automated unit-tests for each components (or page) in order to improve reliability of code.
_Due to limited time I skip some improvements / implementations (you can see these in improvements section)_

## üì¶ Deploy

In order to view a live demo I made a deploy on a virtual machine powered by **AWS EC2** (Ubuntu). I manage process of NodeJS server using [pm2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/) then I use ngnix in order to forward request to right service.

If you want to start locally pokedex you can run script `yarn install` then `yarn run server` and `yarn run client`.

## üìå Improvements

- Boost project collaboration introducing CI/CD workflow
- Use cached data, configuring cache with ApolloClient
- Introduce an error boundary
- Make application layout responsive
- Managing laoding state
- Generate project doc (usign typedoc)
